# Ethical Analysis: AI in Cancer Genomics (Task 4)

**Potential Biases**:
1. Genomic underrepresentation of African (78% of TCGA data is Caucasian)
2. Socioeconomic bias in treatment accessibility

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Active recruitment of diverse populations in studies
2. Algorithmic fairness constraints during model training
3. Continuous bias auditing with real-world deployment data

**Recommendation**:
Implement "Fairness Through Awareness" framework that explicitly considers protected attributes during model development.
