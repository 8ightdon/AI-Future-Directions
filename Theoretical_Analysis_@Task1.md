# Theoretical Analysis (Task 1)

## Q1: Edge AI Advantages

Edge AI processes data locally on devices rather than sending it to the cloud, which:
- Reduces latency by eliminating network round-trips
- Enhances privacy by keeping sensitive data on-device
- Works reliably in low-connectivity environments

**Example**: Autonomous drones using Edge AI can make real-time obstacle avoidance decisions without waiting for cloud processing, crucial for safety in dynamic environments.

## Q2: Quantum vs Classical AI

| Aspect          | Classical AI               | Quantum AI                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Optimization    | Gradient descent          | Quantum annealing             |
| Speed           | Polynomial time           | Exponential speedup potential  |
| Hardware        | Traditional processors    | Qubits (superposition states)  |

**Industries benefiting most**:
- Pharmaceutical (molecular modeling)
- Finance (portfolio optimization)
- Logistics (route optimization)

## Q3: Human-AI Healthcare Collaboration

AI augments healthcare professionals by:
- Providing second opinions on medical imaging
- Automating administrative tasks
- Offering real-time diagnostic support

**Transformation**:
Radiologists will shift from image scanning to overseeing AI diagnoses and patient consultation, while nurses will use AI for patient monitoring and predictive alerts.

# Case Study: AI-IoT for Smart Cities

**Sustainability Benefits**:
1. Dynamic traffic light optimization reduces idling emissions
2. Predictive maintenance of infrastructure saves resources

**Challenges**:
1. Data security vulnerabilities in distributed IoT networks
2. Privacy concerns with pervasive urban sensing
